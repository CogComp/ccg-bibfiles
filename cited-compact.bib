		learning technique that combines reinforcement
			learning with relational learning or inductive logic
			programming. Due to the use of a more expressive
			representation language to represent states, actions
			and Q-functions, relational reinforcement learning
			can be potentially applied to a new range of
			learning tasks. One such task that we investigate is
			planning in the blocks world, where it is assumed
			that the effects of the actions are unknown to the
			agent and the agent has to learn a policy. Within
			this simple domain we show that relational
			reinforcement learning solves some existing problems
			with reinforcement learning.  In particular,
		relational reinforcement learning allows us to
			employ structural representations, to abstract from
			specific goals pursued and to exploit the results of
			previous learning phases when addressing new (more
					complex) situations.},
