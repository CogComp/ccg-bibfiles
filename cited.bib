  Abstract                 = {Cloze-style queries are representative problems in reading comprehension. Over the past few months, we have seen much progress that utilizing neural network approach to solve Cloze-style questions. In this paper, we present a novel model called attention-over-attention reader for the Cloze-style reading comprehension task. Our model aims to place another attention mechanism over the document-level attention, and induces " attended attention " for final predictions. Unlike the previous works, our neural network model requires less pre-defined hyper-parameters and uses an elegant architecture for modeling. Experimental results show that the proposed attention-over-attention model significantly outperforms various state-of-the-art systems by a large margin in public datasets, such as CNN and Children's Book Test datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {The nature of working memory operation during complex sentence comprehension was studied using eye-tracking methodology. Readers had difficulty when the syntax of a sentence required them to hold two similar noun phrases (NPs) in working memory before syntactically and semantically integrating either of the NPs with a verb. In sentence structures that placed these NPs at the same linear distances from one another but allowed integration with a verb for one of the NPs, the comprehension difficulty was not seen. These results are interpreted as indicating that similarity-based interference occurs online during the comprehension of complex sentences and that the degree of memory accessibility conventionally associated with different types of NPs does not have a strong effect on sentence processing.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a simple, elegant solution to use a single Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model to translate between multiple languages. Our solution requires no change in the model architecture from our base system but instead introduces an artificial token at the beginning of the input sentence to specify the required target language. The rest of the model, which includes encoder, decoder and attention, remains unchanged and is shared across all languages. Using a shared wordpiece vocabulary, our approach enables Multilingual NMT using a single model without any increase in parameters, which is significantly simpler than previous proposals for Multilingual NMT. Our method often improves the translation quality of all involved language pairs, even while keeping the total number of model parameters constant. On the WMT'14 benchmarks, a single multilingual model achieves comparable performance for English→French and surpasses state-of-the-art results for English→German. Similarly, a single multilingual model surpasses state-of-the-art results for French→English and German→English on WMT'14 and WMT'15 benchmarks respectively. On production corpora, multilingual models of up to twelve language pairs allow for better translation of many individual pairs. In addition to improving the translation quality of language pairs that the model was trained with, our models can also learn to perform implicit bridging between language pairs never seen explicitly during training, showing that transfer learning and zero-shot translation is possible for neural translation. Finally, we show analyses that hints at a universal interlingua representation in our models and show some interesting examples when mixing languages.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we suggest a novel reinforcement learning architecture, the Natural Actor-Critic. The actor updates are achieved using stochastic policy gradients em-ploying Amari's natural gradient approach, while the critic obtains both the natural policy gradient and additional parameters of a value function simultaneously by lin-ear regression. We show that actor improvements with natural policy gradients are particularly appealing as these are independent of coordinate frame of the chosen policy representation, and can be estimated more efficiently than regular policy gra-dients. The critic makes use of a special basis function parameterization motivated by the policy-gradient compatible function approximation. We show that several well-known reinforcement learning methods such as the original Actor-Critic and Bradtke's Linear Quadratic Q-Learning are in fact Natural Actor-Critic algorithms. Empirical evaluations illustrate the effectiveness of our techniques in comparison to previous methods, and also demonstrate their applicability for learning control on an anthropomorphic robot arm.},

  Abstract                 = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been effectively used to solve complex problems given careful design of the prob-lem and algorithm parameters. However standard RL ap-proaches do not scale particularly well with the size of the problem and often require extensive engineering on the part of the designer to minimize the search space. To alleviate this problem, we present a model-free policy-based approach called Exploration from Demonstration (EfD) that uses hu-man demonstrations to guide search space exploration. We use statistical measures of RL algorithms to provide feed-back to the user about the agent's uncertainty and use this to solicit targeted demonstrations useful from the agent's perspective. The demonstrations are used to learn an ex-ploration policy that actively guides the agent towards im-portant aspects of the problem. We instantiate our approach in a gridworld and a popular arcade game and validate its performance under different experimental conditions. We show how EfD scales to large problems and provides conver-gence speed-ups over traditional exploration and interactive learning methods.},

  Abstract                 = {The prevalent approach to neural machine translation relies on bi-directional LSTMs to encode the source sentence. In this paper we present a faster and con-ceptually simpler architecture based on a succession of convolutional layers. This allows to encode the entire source sentence simultaneously compared to recur-rent networks for which computation is constrained by temporal dependencies. We achieve a new state-of-the-art on WMT'16 English-Romanian translation and outperform several recently published results on the WMT'15 English-German task. We also achieve almost the same accuracy as a very deep LSTM setup on WMT'14 English-French translation. Our convolutional encoder speeds up CPU decoding by more than two times at the same or higher accuracy as a strong bi-directional LSTM baseline.},

Task
* Given a word in context, and a list of paraphrases of the word, rank the paraphrases in order of substitutability
Models of context-aware word representation
* From Thater et al (2011) - No explicit sense representation, but start with individual context-agnostic word representations for the context and target, and reweight target word on the basic of context * Three different models : two syntactical, one BoW * Once context aware representation has been obtained, calculate similarity between that and the target paraphrase and produce a ranked list sorted by similarity.

Key takeaways
* BoW model works almost as well as syntactically influenced models - this is good for us both because a) we are using GloVe which more or less captures coocurance statistics and b) It is easy ot port to multilingual settings since syntactic models need dependency parsers
* They use a similar idea to that of pooling - "A contextualised vector is derived from the basic meaning vector of a target word w by reinforcing its dimensions that are licensed by the context of the specific instance under consideration"},

  Abstract                 = {We present an approach to training neural networks to generate sequences using actor-critic methods from reinforcement learning (RL). Current log-likelihood training methods are limited by the discrepancy between their training and testing modes, as models must generate tokens conditioned on their previous guesses rather than the ground-truth tokens. We address this problem by introducing a $\backslash$textit{\{}critic{\}} network that is trained to predict the value of an output token, given the policy of an $\backslash$textit{\{}actor{\}} network. This results in a training procedure that is much closer to the test phase, and allows us to directly optimize for a task-specific score such as BLEU. Crucially, since we leverage these techniques in the supervised learning setting rather than the traditional RL setting, we condition the critic network on the ground-truth output. We show that our method leads to improved performance on both a synthetic task, and for German-English machine translation. Our analysis paves the way for such methods to be applied in natural language generation tasks, such as machine translation, caption generation, and dialogue modelling.},

Our model aims to place another attention mechanism over the document-level attention, and induces "attended attention" for final predictions. Unlike the previous works, our neural network model requires less pre-defined hyper-parameters and uses an elegant architecture for modeling. Experimental results show that the proposed attention-over-attention model significantly outperforms various state-of-the-art systems by a large margin in public datasets, such as CNN and Children's Book Test datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {We first observe a potential weakness of continuous vector representations of symbols in neural machine translation. That is, the continuous vector representation, or a word embedding vector, of a symbol encodes multiple dimensions of similarity, equivalent to encoding more than one meaning of the word. This has the consequence that the encoder and decoder recurrent networks in neural machine translation need to spend substantial amount of their capacity in disambiguating source and target words based on the context which is defined by a source sentence. Based on this observation, in this paper we propose to contextualize the word embedding vectors using a nonlinear bag-of-words representation of the source sentence. Additionally, we propose to represent special tokens (such as numbers, proper nouns and acronyms) with typed symbols to facilitate translating those words that are not well-suited to be translated via continuous vectors. The experiments on En-Fr and En-De reveal that the proposed approaches of contextualization and symbolization improves the translation quality of neural machine translation systems significantly.},

We propose a vector-space model which provides a formal foundation for a distributional semantics of entailment. Using a mean-field approximation, we develop approximate inference procedures and entailment operators over vectors of probabilities of features being known (versus unknown). We use this framework to reinterpret an existing distributional-semantic model (Word2Vec) as approximating an entailment-based model of the distributions of words in contexts, thereby predicting lexical entailment relations. In both unsupervised and semi-supervised experiments on hyponymy detection, we get substantial improvements over previous results.},

For inference, we extend variational autoencoders to use graphical model approximating distributions with recognition networks that output conjugate potentials. All components of these models are learned simultaneously with a single objective, giving a scalable algorithm that leverages stochastic variational inference, natural gradients, graphical model message passing, and the reparameterization trick. We illustrate this framework with several example models and an application to mouse behavioral phenotyping.},

The ByteNet has two core properties: it runs in time that is linear in the length of the sequences and it preserves the sequences' temporal resolution. The ByteNet decoder attains state-of-the-art performance on character-level language modelling and outperforms the previous best results obtained with recurrent neural networks. The ByteNet also achieves a performance on raw character-level machine translation that approaches that of the best neural translation models that run in quadratic time. The implicit structure learnt by the ByteNet mirrors the expected alignments between the sequences.},

For example it's not clear how they achieve {\{}$\backslash$em compositionality{\}}, building sentence meaning from the meanings of words and phrases. In this paper we describe four strategies for visualizing compositionality in neural models for NLP, inspired by similar work in computer vision. We first plot unit values to visualize compositionality of negation, intensification, and concessive clauses, allow us to see well-known markedness asymmetries in negation. We then introduce three simple and straightforward methods for visualizing a unit's {\{}$\backslash$em salience{\}}, the amount it contributes to the final composed meaning: (1) gradient back-propagation, (2) the variance of a token from the average word node, (3) LSTM-style gates that measure information flow. We test our methods on sentiment using simple recurrent nets and LSTMs. Our general-purpose methods may have wide applications for understanding compositionality and other semantic properties of deep networks , and also shed light on why LSTMs outperform simple recurrent nets,},

In this paper, we propose a general methodology to analyze and interpret decisions from a neural model by observing the effects on the model of erasing various parts of the representation, such as input word-vector dimensions, intermediate hidden units, or input words. We present several approaches to analyzing the effects of such erasure, from computing the relative difference in evaluation metrics, to using reinforcement learning to erase the minimum set of input words in order to flip a neural model's decision. In a comprehensive analysis of multiple NLP tasks, including linguistic feature classification, sentence-level sentiment analysis, and document level sentiment aspect prediction, we show that the proposed methodology not only offers clear explanations about neural model decisions, but also provides a way to conduct error analysis on neural models.},

  Abstract                 = {Context representations are central to vari-ous NLP tasks, such as word sense disam-biguation, named entity recognition, co-reference resolution, and many more. In this work we present a neural model for efficiently learning a generic context em-bedding function from large corpora, us-ing bidirectional LSTM. With a very sim-ple application of our context represen-tations, we manage to surpass or nearly reach state-of-the-art results on sentence completion, lexical substitution and word sense disambiguation tasks, while sub-stantially outperforming the popular con-text representation of averaged word em-beddings. We release our code and pre-trained models, suggesting they could be useful in a wide variety of NLP tasks.},
  Annote                   = {Aim : Generic word embeddings have been helpful. Can we similarly learn generic embeddings for contexts in an unsupervised fashion?

Proposed solution : Use a BiLSTM to embed contexts and words in the same space in a Word2Vec kind of setting.

Model : 1) Run a forward LSTM over left context 2) Run a backward LSTM over right context 3) Concatenate representations for left context and right context 4) Pass this through a two layer feedforward NN. 
The output of this feedforward NN is treated as the embedding for the context. At the same time, you have an embedding for the target word.
The model is trained with a negative sampling objective ala W2V with a positive pair being a target word and its entire context, and k negative pairs being random target words paired with the same context.
Having representations of contexts allows you to compute word-word, word-context, and context-context similarites which will be useful in tasks.

Evaluation : Three tasks - 1) sentence completion, 2) lexical substitution 3) supervised WSD. (1) and 2) are similar except 1) does not require preserving meaning but only selecting the most coherent blank filler)
For 1) and 2), task is solved by calculating similarity between the context and the options. For 3), the task is solved at test time as follows : calculate context-to-context similarity between the context of the word that needs disambiguation, and all other contexts in which this word appeared at training time. Pick the sense which corresponds to the maximally similar context.
All experiments are compared to a word averaging baseline

Comments : It's a trivial but interesting extension to w2v - the averaging of contexts in W2V has been replaced by a bilstm. I like the idea of learning task-independent context representations in general, but I suspect that models that solely rely on such representations are very likely to get superseded by task specific representations. 

Extensions : The model for entailment in context is a close cousin of this model - instead of predicting the word in context, we use the word in context with a word out of context to make a classification decision. If the entailment-in-context model works, it'll be interesting to look at what the context representations look like, and do they generalize to other tasks as well.},

Our results suggest that while intrinsic tasks tend to exhibit a clear preference to particular types of contexts and higher dimensionality, more careful tuning is required for finding the optimal settings for most of the extrinsic tasks that we considered. Furthermore, for these extrinsic tasks, we find that once the benefit from increasing the embedding dimensionality is mostly exhausted, simple concatenation of word embeddings, learned with different context types, can yield further performance gains. As an additional contribution, we propose a new variant of the skip-gram model that learns word embeddings from weighted contexts of substitute words.},

We approach the problem using a reinforce-ment learning framework where our model learns to select optimal actions based on con-textual information. We employ a deep Q-network, trained to optimize a reward func-tion that reflects extraction accuracy while pe-nalizing extra effort. Our experiments on two databases – of shooting incidents, and food adulteration cases – demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms traditional extractors and a competitive meta-classifier baseline.},

These models are typically trained to predict the next word in a sequence, given the previous words and some context such as an image. However, at test time the model is expected to generate the entire sequence from scratch. This discrepancy makes generation brittle, as errors may accumulate along the way. We address this issue by proposing a novel sequence level training algorithm that directly optimizes the BLEU score: a popular metric to compare a sequence to a reference. On three different tasks, our approach outperforms several strong baselines for greedy generation, and it matches their performance with beam search, while being several times faster.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust in a model. Trust is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether or not to deploy a new model. Such understanding further provides insights into the model, which can be used to turn an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We further propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). The usefulness of explanations is shown via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects. Our explanations empower users in various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and detecting why a classifier should not be trusted.},

In this work, we address a real-world scenario where no direct parallel data is available between two views of interest (say, V1 and V2) but parallel data is available between each of these views and a pivot view (V3). We propose a model for learning a common representation for V1, V2 and V3 using only the parallel data available between V1V3 and V2V3. The proposed model is generic and even works when there are n views of interest and only one pivot view which acts as a bridge between them. There are two specific downstream applications that we focus on (i) Transfer learning between languages L1,L2,...,Ln using a pivot language L and (ii) cross modal access between images and a language L1 using a pivot language L2. We evaluate our model using two datasets : (i) publicly available multilingual TED corpus and (ii) a new multilingual multimodal dataset created and released as a part of this work. On both these datasets, our model outperforms state of the art approaches.},

Setup : MDP, Q learning with linear function approximation
Existing exploration apporaches : 1) e-greedy 2) softmax sampling - weigh actions according to q estimates and sample from resulting distribution
Issues : - Redundant exploration - high sample complexity
Idea : Get demonstrations from user based on how uncertain agent is about its model
Quantifying uncertainty:
* First, we quantify how influential each input point is towards the model - more influential points indicate regions of the state space that should be explored further. * Influence is a combination of leverage and discrepancy. * Leverage = how far a specific observation is from the convex hull of known observations. * Discrepancy = how much an observation contributes towards model error
For every transition made by the RL agent, it computes the leverage and discrepancy and compares it to some threshold. If either threshold is exceeded, that observation is influential. To learn more about that observation and reduce its influence, they learn a policy using guidance from a person or a simulated oracle that drives the agent towards these observations.
Designing a policy from parts of the state-action space that the agent knows well and visits often to those with high influence is most likely to encourage exploration},

  Abstract                 = {In this work, we propose Attentive Pooling (AP), a two-way attention mechanism for discriminative model training. In the context of pair-wise ranking or classification with neural networks, AP enables the pooling layer to be aware of the current input pair, in a way that information from the two input items can directly influence the computation of each other's representations. Along with such representations of the paired inputs, AP jointly learns a similarity measure over projected segments (e.g. trigrams) of the pair, and subsequently, derives the corresponding attention vector for each input to guide the pooling. Our two-way attention mechanism is a general framework independent of the underlying representation learning, and it has been applied to both convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in our studies. The empirical results, from three very different benchmark tasks of question answering/answer selection, demonstrate that our proposed models outperform a variety of strong baselines and achieve state-of-the-art performance in all the benchmarks.},
  Annote                   = {Main contribution of the paper : A two-way attention model for pairwise classification/ranking tasks, that lets the two inputs influence the learning of each other's representations

High-level Idea : Given a question with M words and an answer with A words First, use BiLSTM or CNN to get Q, a cxM representation of the question as well as A, a cxL representation of the answer.
Previous methods - Use max - pooling over Q and A seperately to get a c-dimensional representation for both the question (r{\_}q) and the answer (r{\_}a). This method - While doing pooling, let A influence the learning of r{\_}q and let Q influence the learning of r{\_}a
Method: Given Q and A, 1) Calculate G = tanh(Q'UA), where U a similarity metric to learn. G is M x L 2) Do column wise, and row wise max pooling followed by softmax to get two attention vectors g{\_}q and g{\_}a (of M and L dimensions) 3) calculate r{\_}q as Q*g{\_}q and r{\_}a as Q*g{\_}a
Thoughts: What we are doing right now is equivalent to the previous methods described above (instead of using a bilstm, we have fixed embeddings, but everything else goes through). This suggests that the attention pooling mechanism described here could be a novel addition. The authors also propose entailment as an application for this model (although probably textual entailment and not context-sensitive lexical entailment)
The proposed algorithm "projects the paired inputs into a common representation space" even if they are not semantically comparable - this is good for us because we don't want to compare the two sentences exactly as in STS, but projecting both inputs in the same space allows for more reasonable comparisons.
The attention mechanism also has the properties that we've discussed about - essentially it allows us to selectively focus on the words in one part of the input pair, while reading the other},

The only prior model-free TD methods to achieve this with per-step computation linear in the number of function approximation parameters are the gradient-TD family of methods including TDC, GTD($\lambda$), and GQ($\lambda$). Compared to these methods, our emphatic TD($\lambda$) is simpler and easier to use; it has only one learned parameter vector and one step-size parameter. Our treatment includes general state-dependent discount-ing and bootstrapping functions, and a way of specifying varying degrees of interest in accurately valuing different states.},

This structured approach avoids classical biases associated with local training and unifies the training loss with the test-time usage, while preserving the proven model architecture of seq2seq and its efficient training approach.

However, a major limitation of such applications is their demand for massive amounts of training data. A critical present objective is thus to develop deep RL methods that can adapt rapidly to new tasks. In the present work we introduce a novel approach to this challenge, which we refer to as deep meta-reinforcement learning. Previous work has shown that recurrent networks can support meta-learning in a fully supervised context. We extend this approach to the RL setting. What emerges is a system that is trained using one RL algorithm, but whose recurrent dynamics implement a second, quite separate RL procedure. This second, learned RL algorithm can differ from the original one in arbitrary ways. Importantly, because it is learned, it is configured to exploit structure in the training domain. We unpack these points in a series of seven proof-of-concept experiments, each of which examines a key aspect of deep meta-RL. We consider prospects for extending and scaling up the approach, and also point out some potentially important implications for neuroscience.},

  Abstract                 = {Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is an end-to-end learning approach for automated translation, with the potential to overcome many of the weaknesses of conventional phrase-based translation systems. Unfortunately, NMT systems are known to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation inference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues have hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both accuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's Neural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these issues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder layers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and therefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final translation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference computations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited set of common sub-word units ("wordpieces") for both input and output. This method provides a good balance between the flexibility of "character"-delimited models and the efficiency of "word"-delimited models, naturally handles translation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the system. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and uses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that is most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. On the WMT'14 English-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive results to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of isolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60{\%} compared to Google's phrase-based production system.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose the task of free-form and open-ended Visual Question Answering (VQA). Given an image and a natural language question about the image, the task is to provide an accurate natural language answer. Mirroring real-world scenarios, such as helping the visually impaired, both the questions and answers are open-ended. Visual questions selectively target different areas of an image, including background details and underlying context. As a result, a system that succeeds at VQA typically needs a more detailed understanding of the image and complex reasoning than a system producing generic image captions. Moreover, VQA is amenable to automatic evaluation, since many open-ended answers contain only a few words or a closed set of answers that can be provided in a multiple-choice format. We provide a dataset containing {\~{}}0.25M images, {\~{}}0.76M questions, and {\~{}}10M answers (www.visualqa.org), and discuss the information it provides. Numerous baselines and methods for VQA are provided and compared with human performance.},

This is unsatisfactory in many applications where the reference policy is suboptimal and the goal of learning is to improve upon it. Can learning to search work even when the reference is poor? We provide a new learning to search algorithm, LOLS, which does well relative to the reference policy, but additionally guarantees low regret compared to deviations from the learned policy: a local-optimality guarantee. Consequently, LOLS can improve upon the reference policy, unlike previous algorithms. This enables us to develop structured contextual bandits, a partial information structured prediction setting with many potential applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Human brains flexibly combine the meanings of words to compose structured thoughts. For example, by combining the meanings of “bite,” “dog,” and “man,” we can think about a dog biting a man, or a man biting a dog. Here, in two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments using multivoxel pattern analysis (MVPA), we identify a region of left mid-superior temporal cortex (lmSTC) that flexibly encodes “who did what to whom” in visually presented sentences. We find that lmSTC represents the current values of abstract semantic variables (“Who did it?” and “To whom was it done?”) in distinct subregions. Experiment 1 first identifies a broad region of lmSTC whose activity patterns (i) facilitate decoding of structure-dependent sentence meaning (“Who did what to whom?”) and (ii) predict affect-related amygdala responses that depend on this information (e.g., “the baby kicked the grandfather” vs. “the grandfather kicked the baby”). Experiment 2 then identifies distinct, but neighboring, subregions of lmSTC whose activity patterns carry information about the identity of the current “agent” (“Who did it?”) and the current “patient” (“To whom was it done?”). These neighboring subregions lie along the upper bank of the superior temporal sulcus and the lateral bank of the superior temporal gyrus, respectively. At a high level, these regions may function like topographically defined data registers, encoding the fluctuating values of abstract semantic variables. This functional architecture, which in key respects resembles that of a classical computer, may play a critical role in enabling humans to flexibly generate complex thoughts.},
  Annote                   = {This paper performs fMRI experiments to identify regions of the brain that encodes agent/patient information. They have two sets of experiments. 
Experiment 1 ) The objective of this experiment is to identify regions of the brain that encode meaning that is influenced by sentence structure. That is, they want to find regions which can distignuish between 'dog bites man' and 'man bites dog' - which are called "mirror image proposition pairs" here. The hypothesis is that any region which encodes this information should have two properties - first, a classfier built using the region as feature should be able to distinguish between these mirror image prop. pairs. Second, this classifier should also be able to predict affective neural responses in the other part of the brain (for instance between "dad kicks the baby" and "the baby kicks dad")
Experiment 2) This experiments aims to validate the hypothesis that the region of the brain discovered in the previous experiment partially encodes meaning by storing agent/patient information. Again, this can be shown by building a classifier from that region and trying to identify the agent and patient using that classifier.
This kind of architecture can allow for 'flexible' composition from smaller units such as words.

One way to frame this question is as an inductive problem: how can I generalize my previous experience with one set of actions to a novel action? We show how hierarchical Bayesian inference can be used to solve this problem, and describe an equivalence between the Bayesian model and temporal difference learning algorithms that have been proposed as models of human reinforcement learning. In two experiments we test several predictions of this model, providing behavioral evidence that humans learn and exploit structured inductive knowledge to make predictions about novel actions. We suggest a new interpretation of dopaminergic responses to novelty in light of this model. KEYWORDS:},

  Abstract                 = {Dictionary learning and sparse representation (DLSR) is a recent and successful mathematical model for data representation that achieves state-of-the-art performance in various fields such as pattern recognition, machine learning, computer vision, and medical imaging. The original formulation for DLSR is based on the minimization of the reconstruction error between the original signal and its sparse representation in the space of the learned dictionary. Although this formulation is optimal for solving problems such as denoising, inpainting, and coding, it may not lead to optimal solution in classification tasks, where the ultimate goal is to make the learned dictionary and corresponding sparse representation as discriminative as possible. This motivated the emergence of a new category of techniques, which is appropriately called supervised dictionary learning and sparse representation (S-DLSR), leading to more optimal dictionary and sparse representation in classification tasks. Despite many research efforts for S-DLSR, the literature lacks a comprehensive view of these techniques, their connections, advantages and shortcomings. In this paper, we address this gap and provide a review of the recently proposed algorithms for S-DLSR. We first present a taxonomy of these algorithms into six categories based on the approach taken to include label information into the learning of the dictionary and/or sparse representation. For each category, we draw connections between the algorithms in this category and present a unified framework for them. We then provide guidelines for applied researchers on how to represent and learn the building blocks of an S-DLSR solution based on the problem at hand. This review provides a broad, yet deep, view of the state-of-the-art methods for S-DLSR and allows for the advancement of research and development in this emerging area of research.},

We then compare our sentence representations at several granularities using multiple similarity metrics. We apply our model to three tasks, including the Microsoft Research paraphrase identification task and two SemEval semantic textual similarity tasks. We obtain strong performance on all tasks, rivaling or exceeding the state of the art without using external resources such as WordNet or parsers.},

  Abstract                 = {Sequence-to-sequence models have achieved impressive results on various tasks. However, they are unsuitable for tasks that require incremental predictions to be made as more data arrives. This is because they generate an output sequence conditioned on an entire input sequence. In this paper, we present a new model that can make incremental predictions as more input arrives, without redoing the entire computation. Unlike sequence-to-sequence models, our method computes the next-step distribution conditioned on the partial input sequence observed and the partial sequence generated. It accomplishes this goal using an encoder recurrent neural network (RNN) that computes features at the same frame rate as the input, and a transducer RNN that operates over blocks of input steps. The transducer RNN extends the sequence produced so far using a local sequence-to-sequence model. During training, our method uses alignment information to generate supervised targets for each block. Approximate alignment is easily available for tasks such as speech recognition, action recognition in videos, etc. During inference (decoding), beam search is used to find the most likely output sequence for an input sequence. This decoding is performed online - at the end of each block, the best candidates from the previous block are extended through the local sequence-to-sequence model. On TIMIT, our online method achieves 19.8{\%} phone error rate (PER). For comparison with published sequence-to-sequence methods, we used a bidirectional encoder and achieved 18.7{\%} PER. This compares favorably to the best reported sequence-to-sequence model which achieves 17.6{\%}. Importantly, unlike sequence-to-sequence models our model is minimally impacted by the length of the input. On 10-times replicated utterances, it achieves 20.9{\%} with a unidirectional model, compared to 20{\%} from the best bidirectional sequence-to-sequence models.},

To learn the parameters of our model, we use cross-lingual supervision, hypothesizing that a good representation of a word in context will be one that is sufficient for selecting the correct translation into a second language. We evaluate the quality of our representations as features in three downstream tasks: prediction of semantic supersenses (which assign nouns and verbs into a few dozen semantic classes), low resource machine translation, and a lexical substitution task, and obtain state-of-the-art results on all of these.},

In this paper, we close the problem of computationally and sample efficient learning in stochastic combinatorial semi-bandits. In particular, we analyze a UCB-like algorithm for solving the problem, which is known to be computationally efficient; and prove {\$}O(K L (1 / \backslashDelta) \backslashlog n){\$} and {\$}O(\backslashsqrt{\{}K L n \backslashlog n{\}}){\$} upper bounds on its {\$}n{\$}-step regret, where {\$}L{\$} is the number of ground items, {\$}K{\$} is the maximum number of chosen items, and {\$}\backslashDelta{\$} is the gap between the expected returns of the optimal and best suboptimal solutions.

  Abstract                 = {Learning a distinct representation for each sense of an ambiguous word could lead to more powerful and fine-grained models of vector-space representations. Yet while `multi-sense' methods have been proposed and tested on artificial word-similarity tasks, we don't know if they improve real natural language understanding tasks. In this paper we introduce a pipelined architecture for incorporating multi-sense embeddings into language understanding, and test the performance of a state-of-the-art multi-sense embedding model (based on Chinese Restaurant Processes). We apply the model to part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, sentiment analysis, semantic relation identification and semantic relatedness. We find that---if we carefully control for the number of dimensions--- sense-specific embeddings, whether alone or concatenated with standard (one vector for all senses) embeddings, introduce slight performance boost in semantic-related tasks, but is of little in others that depend on correctly identifying a few key words such as sentiment analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent work in learning bilingual repre-sentations tend to tailor towards achiev-ing good performance on bilingual tasks, most often the crosslingual document clas-sification (CLDC) evaluation, but to the detriment of preserving clustering struc-tures of word representations monolin-gually. In this work, we propose a joint model to learn word representations from scratch that utilizes both the con-text coocurrence information through the monolingual component and the meaning equivalent signals from the bilingual con-straint. Specifically, we extend the re-cently popular skipgram model to learn high quality bilingual representations effi-ciently. Our learned embeddings achieve a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 80.3 for the German to English CLDC task and a highly competitive performance of 90.7 for the other classification direction. At the same time, our models outperform best embeddings from past bilingual represen-tation work by a large margin in the mono-lingual word similarity evaluation. 1},

These differences were proven useful for statistical machine translation. However, it has been suggested that the accuracy of translation detection deteriorates when the classifier is evaluated outside the domain it was trained on. We show that this is indeed the case, in a variety of evaluation scenarios. We then show that unsupervised classification is highly accurate on this task. We suggest a method for determining the correct labels of the clustering outcomes, and then use the labels for voting, improving the accuracy even further. Moreover, we suggest a simple method for clustering in the challenging case of mixed-domain datasets, in spite of the dominance of domain-related features over translation-related ones. The result is an effective, fully-unsupervised method for distinguishing between original and translated texts that can be applied to new domains with reasonable accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {Massive knowledge resources, such as Wikidata, can provide valuable informa-tion for lexical inference, especially for proper-names. Prior resource-based ap-proaches typically select the subset of each resource's relations which are relevant for a particular given task. The selection process is done manually, limiting these approaches to smaller resources such as WordNet, which lacks coverage of proper-names and recent terminology. This paper presents a supervised framework for auto-matically selecting an optimized subset of resource relations for a given target infer-ence task. Our approach enables the use of large-scale knowledge resources, thus providing a rich source of high-precision inferences over proper-names. 1},

  Abstract                 = {A stochastic combinatorial semi-bandit is an on-line learning problem where at each step a learn-ing agent chooses a subset of ground items sub-ject to combinatorial constraints, and then ob-serves stochastic weights of these items and re-ceives their sum as a payoff. In this paper, we consider efficient learning in large-scale com-binatorial semi-bandits with linear generaliza-tion, and as a solution, propose two learning al-gorithms called Combinatorial Linear Thomp-son Sampling (CombLinTS) and Combinatorial Linear UCB (CombLinUCB). Both algorithms are computationally efficient as long as the of-fline version of the combinatorial problem can be solved efficiently. We establish that CombLinTS and CombLinUCB are also provably statistically efficient under reasonable assumptions, by devel-oping regret bounds that are independent of the problem scale (number of items) and sublinear in time. We also evaluate CombLinTS on a va-riety of problems with thousands of items. Our experiment results demonstrate that CombLinTS is scalable, robust to the choice of algorithm pa-rameters, and significantly outperforms the best of our baselines.},

  Abstract                 = {We study contextual bandits with budget and time constraints, referred to as constrained contextual bandits.The time and budget constraints significantly complicate the exploration and exploitation tradeoff because they introduce complex coupling among contexts over time.Such coupling effects make it difficult to obtain oracle solutions that assume known statistics of bandits. To gain insight, we first study unit-cost systems with known context distribution. When the expected rewards are known, we develop an approximation of the oracle, referred to Adaptive-Linear-Programming (ALP), which achieves near-optimality and only requires the ordering of expected rewards. With these highly desirable features, we then combine ALP with the upper-confidence-bound (UCB) method in the general case where the expected rewards are unknown {\{}$\backslash$it a priori{\}}. We show that the proposed UCB-ALP algorithm achieves logarithmic regret except for certain boundary cases. Further, we design algorithms and obtain similar regret analysis results for more general systems with unknown context distribution and heterogeneous costs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that shows how to achieve logarithmic regret in constrained contextual bandits.},

  Abstract                 = {Human languages are naturally ambiguous, which makes it difficult to automatically understand the semantics of text. Most vector space models (VSM) treat all occur- rences of a word as the same and build a single vector to represent the meaning of a word, which fails to cap- ture any ambiguity. We present sense-aware semantic analysis (SaSA), a multi-prototype VSM for word repre- sentation based onWikipedia, which could account for homonymy and polysemy. The “sense-specific” proto- types of a word are produced by clustering Wikipedia pages based on both local and global contexts of the word inWikipedia. Experimental evaluation on semantic relatedness for both isolated words and words in senten- tial contexts and word sense induction demonstrate its effectiveness. Introduction},

  Abstract                 = {Pixel-level labelling tasks, such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation from single RGB image, play a central role in image understanding. Recent approaches have attempted to harness the capabilities of deep learning techniques for image recognition to tackle pixel-level labelling tasks. To solve this problem, we introduce a new form of convolutional neural network, called CRF-RNN, which expresses a Conditional Random Field (CRF) as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Our short network can be plugged in as a part of a deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to obtain an end-to-end system that has desirable properties of both CNNs and CRFs. Importantly, our system fully integrates CRF modelling with CNNs, making it possible to train the whole system end-to-end with the usual back-propagation algorithm. We apply this framework to the problem of semantic image segmentation, obtaining competitive results with the state-of-the-art without the need of introducing any post-processing method for object delineation.},

  Abstract                 = {Neural machine translation is a recently proposed approach to machine transla-tion. Unlike the traditional statistical machine translation, the neural machine translation aims at building a single neural network that can be jointly tuned to maximize the translation performance. The models proposed recently for neu-ral machine translation often belong to a family of encoder–decoders and encode a source sentence into a fixed-length vector from which a decoder generates a translation. In this paper, we conjecture that the use of a fixed-length vector is a bottleneck in improving the performance of this basic encoder–decoder architec-ture, and propose to extend this by allowing a model to automatically (soft-)search for parts of a source sentence that are relevant to predicting a target word, without having to form these parts as a hard segment explicitly. With this new approach, we achieve a translation performance comparable to the existing state-of-the-art phrase-based system on the task of English-to-French translation. Furthermore, qualitative analysis reveals that the (soft-)alignments found by the model agree well with our intuition.},

  Abstract                 = {What does it mean for an algorithm to be biased? In U.S. law, unintentional bias is encoded via disparate impact, which occurs when a selection process has widely different outcomes for different groups, even as it appears to be neutral. This legal determination hinges on a definition of a protected class (ethnicity, gender, religious practice) and an explicit description of the process. When the process is implemented using computers, determining disparate impact (and hence bias) is harder. It might not be possible to disclose the process. In addition, even if the process is open, it might be hard to elucidate in a legal setting how the algorithm makes its decisions. Instead of requiring access to the algorithm, we propose making inferences based on the data the algorithm uses. We make four contributions to this problem. First, we link the legal notion of disparate impact to a measure of classification accuracy that while known, has received relatively little attention. Second, we propose a test for disparate impact based on analyzing the information leakage of the protected class from the other data attributes. Third, we describe methods by which data might be made unbiased. Finally, we present empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of our test for disparate impact and our approach for both masking bias and preserving relevant information in the data. Interestingly, our approach resembles some actual selection practices that have recently received legal scrutiny.},

  Abstract                 = {Greedy transition-based parsers are very fast but tend to suffer from error propagation. This problem is aggravated by the fact that they are normally trained using oracles that are deterministic and incomplete in the sense that they assume a unique canonical path through the transition system and are only valid as long as the parser does not stray from this path. In this paper, we give a general characterization of oracles that are nondeterministic and complete, present a method for deriving such oracles for transition systems that satisfy a property we call arc decomposition, and instantiate this method for three well-known transition systems from the literature. We say that these oracles are dynamic, because they allow us to dynamically explore alternative and non-optimal paths during training �� in contrast to oracles that statically assume a unique optimal path. Experimental evaluation on a wide range of data sets clearly shows that using dynamic oracles to train greedy parsers gives substantial improvements in accuracy. Moreover, this improvement comes at no cost in terms of efficiency, unlike other techniques like beam search.},

However, this enhancement is limited to projective parsing, and dynamic oracles have not yet been implemented for parsers supporting non-projectivity. In this paper we introduce the first such oracle, for a non-projective parser based on Attardi's parser. We show that training with this oracle improves parsing accuracy over a conventional (static) oracle on a wide range of datasets.},

  Abstract                 = {The combination of modern Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning approaches holds the promise of making significant progress on challenging applications requiring both rich perception and policy-selection. The Arcade Learning Environment (ALE) provides a set of Atari games that represent a useful benchmark set of such applications. A recent breakthrough in combining model-free reinforcement learning with deep learning, called DQN, achieves the best realtime agents thus far. Planning-based approaches achieve far higher scores than the best model-free approaches, but they exploit information that is not available to human players, and they are orders of magnitude slower than needed for real-time play. Our main goal in this work is to build a better real-time Atari game playing agent than DQN. The central idea is to use the slow planning-based agents to provide training data for a deep-learning architecture capable of real-time play. We proposed new agents based on this idea and show that they outperform DQN.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a novel technique for learn- ing semantic representations, which ex- tends the distributional hypothesis to mul- tilingual data and joint-space embeddings. Our models leverage parallel data and learn to strongly align the embeddings of semantically equivalent sentences, while maintaining sufficient distance between those of dissimilar sentences. The mod- els do not rely on word alignments or any syntactic information and are success- fully applied to a number of diverse lan- guages. We extend our approach to learn semantic representations at the document level, too. We evaluate these models on two cross-lingual document classification tasks, outperforming the prior state of the art. Through qualitative analysis and the study of pivoting effects we demonstrate that our representations are semantically plausible and can capture semantic rela- tionships across languages without paral- lel data. 1},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes our participation in the SemEval-2014 tasks 1, 3 and 10. We used an uniform approach for addressing all the tasks using the soft cardinality for extracting features from text pairs, and machine learning for predicting the gold standards. Our submitted systems ranked among the top systems in all the task and sub-tasks in which we participated. These results confirm the results obtained in pre- vious SemEval campaigns suggesting that the soft cardinality is a simple and useful tool for addressing a wide range of natural language processing problems.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent methods for learning vector space representations of words have succeeded in capturing fine-grained semantic and syntactic regularities using vector arith- metic, but the origin of these regularities has remained opaque. We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. The result is a new global log- bilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word co- occurrence matrix, rather than on the en- tire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. On a recent word analogy task our model obtains 75{\%} accuracy, an improvement of 11{\%} over Mikolov et al. (2013). It also outperforms related word vector models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition.}

These approaches to imitation learning, however, neither require nor benefit from information about the cost of actions. We extend existing results in two directions: first, we develop an interactive imitation learning approach that leverages cost information; second, we extend the technique to address reinforcement learning. The results provide theoretical support to the commonly observed successes of online approximate policy iteration. Our approach suggests a broad new family of algorithms and provides a unifying view of existing techniques for imitation and reinforcement learning.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper considers the use of a simple posterior sampling algorithm to balance between exploration and exploitation when learning to optimize actions such as in multiarmed bandit problems. The algorithm, also known as Thompson Sampling and as probability matching, offers significant advantages over the popular upper confidence bound (UCB) approach, and can be applied to problems with finite or infinite action spaces and complicated relationships among action rewards. We make two theoretical contributions. The first establishes a connection between posterior sampling and UCB algorithms. This result lets us convert regret bounds developed for UCB algorithms into Bayesian regret bounds for posterior sampling. Our second theoretical contribution is a Bayesian regret bound for posterior sampling that applies broadly and can be specialized to many model classes. This bound depends on a new notion we refer to as the eluder dimension, which measures the degree of dependence among action rewards. Compared to UCB algorithm Bayesian regret bounds for specific model classes, our general bound matches the best available for linear models and is stronger than the best available for generalized linear models. Further, our analysis provides insight into performance advantages of posterior sampling, which are highlighted through simulation results that demonstrate performance surpassing recently proposed UCB algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {Choice models are today ubiquitous across a range of applications in operations and marketing. Real world implementations of many of these models face the formidable stumbling block of simply identifying the 'right' model of choice to use. Since models of choice are inherently high dimensional objects, the typical approach to dealing with this problem is positing, a-priori, a parametric model that one believes adequately captures choice behavior. This approach can be substantially sub-optimal in scenarios where one cares about using the choice model learned to make fine-grained predictions; one must contend with the risks of mis-specification and over/under-fitting. Thus motivated, we visit the following problem: For a 'generic' model of consumer choice (namely, dis-tributions over preference lists) and a limited amount of data on how consumers actually make decisions (such as marginal information about these distributions), how may one predict revenues from offering a particular assortment of choices? An outcome of our investigation is a non-parametric approach in which the data automatically selects the 'right' choice model for revenue predictions. The approach is practical. Using a data set consisting of automobile sales transaction data from a major US automaker, our method demonstrates a 20{\%} improvement in prediction accuracy over state-of-the art benchmark models, which can result in a 10{\%} increase in revenues from optimizing the offer set. We also address a number of theoretical issues, among them a qualitative examination of the choice models implicitly learned by the approach. We believe that this paper takes a step towards 'automating' the crucial task of choice model selection.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a method that learns word em- bedding for Twitter sentiment classifica- tion in this paper. Most existing algorithm- s for learning continuous word represen- tations typically only model the syntactic context of words but ignore the sentimen- t of text. This is problematic for senti- ment analysis as they usually map word- s with similar syntactic context but oppo- site sentiment polarity, such as good and bad, to neighboring word vectors. We address this issue by learning sentiment- specific word embedding (SSWE), which encodes sentiment information in the con- tinuous representation of words. Specif- ically, we develop three neural networks to effectively incorporate the supervision from sentiment polarity of text (e.g. sen- tences or tweets) in their loss function- s. To obtain large scale training corpora, we learn the sentiment-specific word em- bedding from massive distant-supervised tweets collected by positive and negative emoticons. Experiments on applying SS- WE to a benchmark Twitter sentimen- t classification dataset in SemEval 2013 show that (1) the SSWE feature performs comparably with hand-crafted features in the top-performed system; (2) the perfor- mance is further improved by concatenat- ing SSWE with existing feature set.},

  Abstract                 = {We de ne a general framework for a large class of combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) problems, where simple arms with unknown distributions form super arms. In each round, a super arm is played and the outcomes of its related simple arms are ob- served, which helps the selection of super arms in future rounds. The reward of the su- per arm depends on the outcomes of played arms, and it only needs to satisfy two mild assumptions, which allow a large class of nonlinear reward instances. We assume the availability of an ( ; )-approximation ora- cle that takes the means of the distributions of arms and outputs a super arm that with probability generates an fraction of the optimal expected reward. The objective of a CMAB algorithm is to minimize ( ; )- approximation regret, which is the di erence in total expected reward between the frac- tion of expected reward when always playing the optimal super arm, and the expected re- ward of playing super arms according to the algorithm. We provide CUCB algorithm that achieves O(log n) regret, where n is the num- ber of rounds played, and we further provide distribution-independent bounds for a large class of reward functions. Our regret analysis is tight in that it matches the bound for clas- sical MAB problem up to a constant factor, and it signi cantly improves the regret bound in a recent paper on combinatorial bandits with linear rewards. We apply our CMAB framework to two new applications, proba- bilistic maximum coverage (PMC) for online advertising and social in uence maximization for viral marketing, both having nonlinear re- ward structures.},

  Abstract                 = {Structured prediction is the problem of learning a func- tion from structured inputs to structured outputs. In- spired by the recent successes of search-based struc- tured prediction, we introduce a new framework for structured prediction called HC-Search. Given a struc- tured input, the framework uses a search procedure guided by a learned heuristic H to uncover high qual- ity candidate outputs and then uses a separate learned cost function C to select a final prediction among those outputs.We can decompose the regret of the overall ap- proach into the loss due to H not leading to high qual- ity outputs, and the loss due to C not selecting the best among the generated outputs. Guided by this decompo- sition, we minimize the overall regret in a greedy stage- wise manner by first trainingHto quickly uncover high quality outputs via imitation learning, and then training C to correctly rank the outputs generated viaHaccord- ing to their true losses. Experiments on several bench- mark domains show that our approach significantly out- performs the state-of-the-art methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Modelling the compositional process by which the meaning of an utterance arises from the meaning of its parts is a fundamental task of Natural Language Processing. In this paper we draw upon recent advances in the learning of vector space representations of sentential semantics and the transparent interface between syntax and semantics provided by Combinatory Categorial Grammar to introduce Combinatory Categorial Autoencoders. This model leverages the CCG combinatory operators to guide a non-linear transformation of meaning within a sentence. We use this model to learn high dimensional embeddings for sentences and evaluate them in a range of tasks, demonstrating that the incorporation of syntax allows a concise model to learn representations that are both effective and general.},

The resulting algorithms, which repeatedly compute and then efficiently optimize submodular semigradients, offer new and generalize many old methods for submodular optimization. Our approach, moreover, takes steps towards providing a unifying paradigm applicable to both submodular min- imization and maximization, problems that historically have been treated quite distinctly. The practicality of our algorithms is important since interest in submodularity, owing to its natural and wide applicability, has recently been in ascendance within machine learning. We analyze theoretical properties of our algorithms for minimization and maximization, and show that many state-of-the-art maximization algorithms are special cases. Lastly, we complement our theoretical analyses with supporting empirical experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {We propose a Learning from Demonstration (LfD) algorithm which leverages ex-pert data, even if they are very few or inaccurate. We achieve this by using both expert data, as well as reinforcement signals gathered through trial-and-error inter-actions with the environment. The key idea of our approach, Approximate Policy Iteration with Demonstration (APID), is that expert's suggestions are used to de-fine linear constraints which guide the optimization performed by Approximate Policy Iteration. We prove an upper bound on the Bellman error of the estimate computed by APID at each iteration. Moreover, we show empirically that APID outperforms pure Approximate Policy Iteration, a state-of-the-art LfD algorithm, and supervised learning in a variety of scenarios, including when very few and/or suboptimal demonstrations are available. Our experiments include simulations as well as a real robot path-finding task.},

A re-cent line of work, which addresses context sensitivity of rules, represented contexts in a latent topic space and computed similar-ity over topic vectors. We propose a novel two-level model, which computes simi-larities between word-level vectors that are biased by topic-level context repre-sentations. Evaluations on a naturally-distributed dataset show that our model significantly outperforms prior word-level and topic-level models. We also release a first context-sensitive inference rule set.},

In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alterna- tive to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of “Canada” and “Air” cannot be easily combined to obtain “Air Canada”. Motivated by this example,we present a simplemethod for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.},

  Abstract                 = {Inference in natural language often involves recognizing lexical entailment (RLE); that is, identifying whether one word entails another. For example, "buy" entails "own". Two general strategies for RLE have been proposed: One strategy is to manually construct an asymmetric similarity measure for context vectors (directional similarity) and another is to treat RLE as a problem of learning to recognize semantic relations using supervised machine learning techniques (relation classification). In this paper, we experiment with two recent state-of-the-art representatives of the two general strategies. The first approach is an asymmetric similarity measure (an instance of the directional similarity strategy), designed to capture the degree to which the contexts of a word, a, form a subset of the contexts of another word, b. The second approach (an instance of the relation classification strategy) represents a word pair, a:b, with a feature vector that is the concatenation of the context vectors of a and b, and then applies supervised learning to a training set of labeled feature vectors. Additionally, we introduce a third approach that is a new instance of the relation classification strategy. The third approach represents a word pair, a:b, with a feature vector in which the features are the differences in the similarities of a and b to a set of reference words. All three approaches use vector space models (VSMs) of semantics, based on word-context matrices. We perform an extensive evaluation of the three approaches using three different datasets. The proposed new approach (similarity differences) performs significantly better than the other two approaches on some datasets and there is no dataset for which it is significantly worse. Our results suggest it is beneficial to make connections between the research in lexical entailment and the research in semantic relation classification.},

  Abstract                 = {We introduce two ways to detect entail-ment using distributional semantic repre-sentations of phrases. Our first experiment shows that the entailment relation between adjective-noun constructions and their head nouns (big cat |= cat), once represented as semantic vector pairs, generalizes to lexical entailment among nouns (dog |= animal). Our second experiment shows that a classi-fier fed semantic vector pairs can similarly generalize the entailment relation among quantifier phrases (many dogs|=some dogs) to entailment involving unseen quantifiers (all cats|=several cats). Moreover, nominal and quantifier phrase entailment appears to be cued by different distributional corre-lates, as predicted by the type-based view of entailment in formal semantics.},

  Abstract                 = {Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is a recently proposed search method that combines the precision of tree search with the generality of random sampling. It has received considerable interest due to its spectacular success in the difficult problem of computer Go, but has also proved beneficial in a range of other domains. This paper is a survey of the literature to date, intended to provide a snapshot of the state of the art after the first five years of MCTS research. We outline the core algorithm's derivation, impart some structure on the many variations and enhancements that have been proposed, and summarise the results from the key game and non-game domains to which MCTS methods have been applied. A number of open research questions indicate that the field is ripe for future work.},

  Abstract                 = {The most widely adopted approaches for evaluation of summary content follow some protocol for comparing a summary with gold-standard human summaries, which are traditionally called model summaries. This evaluation paradigm falls short when human summaries are not available and becomes less accurate when only a single model is available. We propose three novel evaluation techniques. Two of them are model-free and do not rely on a gold standard for the assessment. The third technique improves standard automatic evaluations by expanding the set of available model summaries with chosen system summaries. We show that quantifying the similarity between the source text and its summary with appropriately chosen measures produces summary scores which replicate human assessments accurately. We also explore ways of increasing evaluation quality when only one human model summary is available as a gold standard. We introduce pseudomodels, which are system sum- maries deemed to contain good content according to automatic evaluation. Combining the pseudomodels with the single human model to form the gold-standard leads to higher correlations with human judgments compared to using only the one available model. Finally, we explore the feasibility of another measure—similarity between a system summary and the pool of all other system summaries for the same input. This method of comparison with the consensus of systems produces impressively accurate rankings of system summaries, achieving correlation with human rankings above 0.9.},

  Abstract                 = {We present an unsupervised model for joint phrase alignment and extraction using non- parametric Bayesian methods and inversion transduction grammars (ITGs). The key con- tribution is that phrases of many granulari- ties are included directly in the model through the use of a novel formulation that memorizes phrases generated not only by terminal, but also non-terminal symbols. This allows for a completely probabilistic model that is able to create a phrase table that achieves com- petitive accuracy on phrase-based machine translation tasks directly from unaligned sen- tence pairs. Experiments on several language pairs demonstrate that the proposed model matches the accuracy of traditional two-step word alignment/phrase extraction approach while reducing the phrase table to a fraction of the original size.},

  Abstract                 = {Many machine learning approaches in robotics, based on reinforcement learning, inverse optimal control or direct policy learning, critically rely on robot simulators. This paper investigates a simulatorfree direct policy learning, called Preference − based Policy Learning (PPL). PPL iterates a four-step process: the robot demonstrates a candidate policy; the expert ranks this policy comparatively to other ones according to her preferences; these preferences are used to learn a policy return estimate; the robot uses the policy return estimate to build new candidate policies, and the process is iterated until the desired behavior is obtained. PPL requires a good representation of the policy search space be available, enabling one to learn accurate policy return estimates and limiting the human ranking effort needed to yield a good policy. Furthermore, this representation cannot use informed features (e.g., how far the robot is from any target) due to the simulator-free setting. As a second contribution, this paper proposes a representation based on the agnostic exploitation of the robotic log. The convergence of PPL is analytically studied and its experimental validation on two problems, involving a single robot in a maze and two interacting robots, is presented.},

It is thus possible to assess the ability of a model to detect truly related word pairs, as well as to perform in-depth analyses of the types of semantic relations that a model favors. We discuss the motivations for BLESS, describe its construction and structure, and present examples of its usage in the evaluation of distributional semantic models.},

  Abstract                 = {It is commonly stated that reinforcement learning (RL) algo- rithms require more samples to learn than humans. In this work, we investigate this claim using two standard problems fromthe RL literature. We compare the performance of human subjects to RL techniques. We find that contextthe meaningfulness of the observationsplays a significant role in the rate of human RL. Moreover, without contextual information, hu- mans often fare much worse than classic algorithms. Compar- ing the detailed responses of humans and RL algorithms, we also find that humans appear to employ rather different strate- gies from standard algorithms, even in cases where they had indistinguishable performance to them.},
  Annote                   = {What is the rate at which humans learn v/s the rate at which RL aglorithms learn? * Contextual information plays a big role in rate of human RL * Without context, humans {\textless}{\textless} RL
Setting : * POMDP environment * C+ : Observations had meaning in the context of the task * C- : No meaning to observations
Tasks:
1) Tigerworld
* Two doors, one with tiger (-100), one with reward (+10) * Actions - Open left, open right, listen (which has 85{\%} chance of correct, reward -1) * C+ observations : Tigeron left/right images * C- obersvations : Fruit image, actions replaced by numbers
2) Gridworld
* Standard gridworld * In C-, each observation was mapped to a specific fruit. The action buttons were also numbered instead of labeled with compass direc- tions.
Results
* C+ and C- do almost equally well, but C- is slower},

  Abstract                 = {We describe a new approach for modeling the distribution of high-dimensional vectors of discrete variables. This model is inspired by the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), which has been shown to be a powerful model of such distributions. However, an RBM typically does not provide a tractable distribution estimator, since evaluating the probability it assigns to some given observation requires the computation of the so-called partition function, which itself is intractable for RBMs of even moderate size. Our model circumvents this difficulty by decomposing the joint distribution of observations into tractable conditional distributions and modeling each conditional using a non-linear function similar to a conditional of an RBM. Our model can also be interpreted as an autoencoder wired such that its output can be used to assign valid probabilities to observations. We show that this new model outperforms other multivariate binary distribution estimators on several datasets and performs similarly to a large (but intractable) RBM.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper explores the use of bilingual parallel corpora as a source of lexical knowledge for cross-lingual textual entailment. We claim that, in spite of the inherent difficulties of the task, phrase tables extracted from parallel data allow to capture both lexical relations between single words, and contextual information useful for inference. We experiment with a phrasal matching method in order to: i) build a system portable across languages, and ii) evaluate the contribution of lexical knowledge in isolation, without interaction with other inference mechanisms. Results achieved on an English-Spanish corpus obtained from the RTE3 dataset support our claim, with an overall accuracy above average scores reported by RTE participants on monolingual data. Finally, we show that using parallel corpora to extract paraphrase tables reveals their potential also in the monolingual setting, improving the results achieved with other sources of lexical knowledge.},

Contextualization of a vector is realized by reweighting its components, based on distributional infor- mation about the context words. Evalua- tion on a paraphrase ranking task derived from the SemEval 2007 Lexical Substi- tution Task shows that our model outper- forms all previous models on this task. We showthat our model supports a wider range of applications by evaluating it on a word sense disambiguation task. Results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art per- formance. 1},

  Abstract                 = {Naively collecting translations by crowd- sourcing the task to non-professional trans- lators yields disfluent, low-quality results if no quality control is exercised. We demon- strate a variety of mechanisms that increase the translation quality to near professional lev- els. Specifically, we solicit redundant transla- tions and edits to them, and automatically se- lect the best output among them. We propose a set of features that model both the translations and the translators, such as country of resi- dence, LM perplexity of the translation, edit rate from the other translations, and (option- ally) calibration against professional transla- tors. Using these features to score the col- lected translations, we are able to discriminate between acceptable and unacceptable transla- tions. We recreate the NIST 2009 Urdu-to- English evaluation set with Mechanical Turk, and quantitatively show that our models are able to select translations within the range of quality that we expect from professional trans- lators. The total cost is more than an order of magnitude lower than professional translation.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a general learning framework for a class of problems that require learning over latent intermediate representations. Many natural language processing (NLP) decision problems are defined over an expressive intermediate representation that is not explicit in the input, leaving the algorithm with both the task of recovering a good intermediate representation and learning to classify correctly. Most current systems separate the learning problem into two stages by solving the first step of recovering the intermediate representation heuristically and using it to learn the final classifier. This paper develops a novel joint learning algorithm for both tasks, that uses the final prediction to guide the selection of the best intermediate representation. We evaluate our algorithm on three different NLP tasks – transliteration, paraphrase identification and textual entailment – and show that our joint method significantly improves performance. 1},

  Abstract                 = {The computation of meaning similarity as operationalized by vector-based models has found widespread use in many tasks ranging from the acquisition of synonyms and paraphrases to word sense disambiguation and textual entailment. Vector-based models are typically directed at representing words in isolation and thus best suited for measuring similarity out of context. In his paper we propose a probabilistic framework for measuring similarity in context. Central to our approach is the intuition that word meaning is represented as a probability distribution over a set of latent senses and is modulated by context. Experimental results on lexical substitution and word similarity show that our algorithm outperforms previously proposed models.},

  Abstract                 = {Distributional word similarity is most commonly perceived as a symmetric relation. Yet, directional relations are abundant in lexical semantics and in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) settings that require lexical inference, making symmetric similarity measures less suitable for their identification. This paper investigates the nature of directional (asymmetric) similarity measures that aim to quantify distributional feature inclusion. We identify desired properties of such measures for lexical inference, specify a particular measure based on Average Precision that addresses these properties, and demonstrate the empirical benefit of directional measures for two different NLP datasets.},

The architecture com- bines various linguistically-motivated clas- sification features in a Bayesian Network. We introduce novel ways for computing many of these features, and manually de- fine linguistically-motivated interrelationships among them, which the Bayesian network models. Our methodology is almost en- tirely unsupervised and completely language- independent; it relies on few language re- sources and is thus suitable for a large num- ber of languages. Furthermore, unlike much recent work, our approach can identify ex- pressions of various types and syntactic con- structions.

  Abstract                 = {Vector-based models of word meaning have become increasingly popular in cognitive science. The appeal of these models lies in their ability to represent meaning simply by using distributional information under the assumption that words occurring within similar contexts are semantically similar. Despite their widespread use, vector-based models are typically directed at representing words in isolation, and methods for constructing representations for phrases or sentences have received little attention in the literature. This is in marked contrast to experimental evidence (e.g., in sentential priming) suggesting that semantic similarity is more complex than simply a relation between isolated words. This article proposes a framework for representing the meaning of word combinations in vector space. Central to our approach is vector composition, which we operationalize in terms of additive and multiplicative functions. Under this framework, we introduce a wide range of composition models that we evaluate empirically on a phrase similarity task.},

  Abstract                 = {The quality of a statistical machine transla- tion (SMT) system is heavily dependent upon the amount of parallel sentences used in train- ing. In recent years, there have been several approaches developed for obtaining parallel sentences from non-parallel, or comparable data, such as news articles published within the same time period (Munteanu and Marcu, 2005), or web pages with a similar structure (Resnik and Smith, 2003). One resource not yet thoroughly explored isWikipedia, an on- line encyclopedia containing linked articles in many languages. We advance the state of the art in parallel sentence extraction by modeling the document level alignment, mo- tivated by the observation that parallel sen- tence pairs are often found in close proximity. We also include features which make use of the additional annotation given byWikipedia, and features using an automatically induced lexicon model. Results for both accuracy in sentence extraction and downstream im- provement in an SMT system are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Humans are adept at inferring the mental states underlying other agents' actions, such as goals, beliefs, desires, emotions and other thoughts. We propose a computational framework based on Bayesian inverse planning for modeling human action understanding. The framework represents an intuitive theory of intentional agents' behavior based on the principle of rationality: the expectation that agents will plan approximately rationally to achieve their goals, given their beliefs about the world. The mental states that caused an agent's behavior are inferred by inverting this model of rational planning using Bayesian inference, integrating the likelihood of the observed actions with the prior over mental states. This approach formalizes in precise probabilistic terms the essence of previous qualitative approaches to action understanding based on an "intentional stance" [Dennett, D. C. (1987). The intentional stance. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press] or a "teleological stance" [Gergely, G., N??dasdy, Z., Csibra, G., {\&} Bir??, S. (1995). Taking the intentional stance at 12 months of age. Cognition, 56, 165-193]. In three psychophysical experiments using animated stimuli of agents moving in simple mazes, we assess how well different inverse planning models based on different goal priors can predict human goal inferences. The results provide quantitative evidence for an approximately rational inference mechanism in human goal inference within our simplified stimulus paradigm, and for the flexible nature of goal representations that human observers can adopt. We discuss the implications of our experimental results for human action understanding in real-world contexts, and suggest how our framework might be extended to capture other kinds of mental state inferences, such as inferences about beliefs, or inferring whether an entity is an intentional agent. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Our technique makes use of a set of near-optimal trajectories to discover options and incorporates them into the learning process, dramatically re- ducing the time it takes to solve the underlying problem. We run a series of experiments in two different domains and show that our method of- fers up to 30 fold speedup over the baseline},

  Abstract                 = {We address the task of computing vector space representations for the meaning of word occurrences, which can vary widely according to context. This task is a crucial step towards a robust, vector-based compositional account of sentence meaning. We argue that existing models for this task do not take syntactic structure sufficiently into account.$\backslash$nWe present a novel structured vector space model that addresses these issues by incorporating the selectional preferences for words' argument positions. This makes it possible to integrate syntax into the computation of word meaning in context. In addition, the model performs at and above the state of the art for modeling the contextual adequacy of paraphrases.},

  Abstract                 = {Autonomous learning is one of the hallmarks of human and animal behavior, and understanding the principles of learning will be crucial in order to achieve true autonomy in advanced machines like humanoid robots. In this paper, we examine learning of complex motor skills with human-like limbs. While supervised learning can offer useful tools for bootstrapping behavior, e.g., by learning from demonstration, it is only reinforcement learning that offers a general approach to the final trial-and-error improvement that is needed by each individual acquiring a skill. Neither neurobiological nor machine learning studies have, so far, offered compelling results on how reinforcement learning can be scaled to the high-dimensional continuous state and action spaces of humans or humanoids. Here, we combine two recent research developments on learning motor control in order to achieve this scaling. First, we interpret the idea of modular motor control by means of motor primitives as a suitable way to generate parameterized control policies for reinforcement learning. Second, we combine motor primitives with the theory of stochastic policy gradient learning, which currently seems to be the only feasible framework for reinforcement learning for humanoids. We evaluate different policy gradient methods with a focus on their applicability to parameterized motor primitives. We compare these algorithms in the context of motor primitive learning, and show that our most modern algorithm, the Episodic Natural Actor-Critic outperforms previous algorithms by at least an order of magnitude. We demonstrate the efficiency of this reinforcement learning method in the application of learning to hit a baseball with an anthropomorphic robot arm. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

  Abstract                 = {Reinforcement learning models that focus on the striatum and dopamine can predict the choices of animals and people. Representations of reward expectation and of reward prediction errors that are pertinent to decision making, however, are not confined to these regions but are also found in prefrontal and cingulate cortex. Moreover, decisions are not guided solely by the magnitude of the reward that is expected. Uncertainty in the estimate of the reward expectation, the value of information that might be gained by taking a course of action and the cost of an action all influence the manner in which decisions are made through prefrontal and cingulate cortex.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we describe the English Lexical Substitution task for SemEval. In the task, annotators and systems find an alternative substitute word or phrase for a target word in context. The task involves both finding the synonyms and disambiguating the context. Participating systems are free to use any lex-ical resource. There is a subtask which re-quires identifying cases where the word is functioning as part of a multiword in the sen-tence and detecting what that multiword is.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a novel method for extracting parallel sub-sentential fragments from comparable, non-parallel bilingual corpora. By analyzing potentially similar sentence pairs using a signal processing-inspired approach, we detect which segments of the source sentence are translated into segments in the target sentence, and which are not. This method enables us to extract useful machine translation training data even from very non-parallel corpora, which contain no parallel sentence pairs. We evaluate the quality of the extracted data by showing that it improves the performance of a state-of-the-art statistical machine translation system.},

  Abstract                 = {Imitation learning of sequential, goaldirected behavior by standard supervised techniques is often difficult. We frame learning such behaviors as a maximum margin structured prediction problem over a space of policies. In this approach, we learn mappings from features to cost so an optimal policy in an MDP with these cost mimics the expert's behavior. Further, we demonstrate a simple, provably efficient approach to structured maximum margin learning, based on the subgradient method, that leverages existing fast algorithms for inference. Although the technique is general, it is particularly relevant in problems where A * and dynamic programming approaches make learning policies tractable in problems beyond the limitations of a QP formulation. We demonstrate our approach applied to route planning for outdoor mobile robots, where the behavior a designer wishes a planner to execute is often clear, while specifying cost functions that engender this behavior is a much more difficult task. 1.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a novel method for discovering parallel sentences in comparable, non-parallel corpora. We train a maximum entropy classifier that, given a pair of sentences, can reliably determine whether or not they are translations of each other. Using this approach, we extract parallel data from large Chinese, Arabic, and English non-parallel newspaper corpora. We evaluate the quality of the extracted data by showing that it improves the performance of a state-of-the-art statistical machine translation system. We also show that a good-quality MT system can be built from scratch by starting with a very small parallel corpus (100,000 words) and exploiting a large non-parallel corpus. Thus, our method can be applied with great benefit to language pairs for which only scarce resources are available.},

Based on the principle of storing and reusing transition experiences, a model-free, neural network based Reinforcement Learning algorithm is proposed. The method is evaluated on three benchmark problems. It is shown empirically, that reasonably few interactions with the plant are needed to generate control policies of high quality.},

  Abstract                 = {We consider the policy search approach to reinforcement learning. We show that if a " baseline distribution " is given (indicating roughly how often we expect a good policy to visit each state), then we can derive a policy search algorithm that terminates in a finite number of steps, and for which we can provide non-trivial performance guarantees. We also demonstrate this algorithm on several grid-world POMDPs, a planar biped walking robot, and a double-pole balancing problem.},

  Abstract                 = {We show how a standard tool from statistics namely confidence bounds can be used to elegantly deal with situations which exhibit an exploitation-exploration trade-off. Our technique for designing and analyzing algorithms for such situations is general and can be applied when an algorithm has to make exploitation-versus-exploration decisions based on uncertain information provided by a random process. We apply our technique to two models with such an exploitation-exploration trade-off. For the adversarial bandit problem with shifting our new algorithm suffers only O((ST)1/2) regret with high probability over T trials with S shifts. Such a regret bound was previously known only in expectation. The second model we consider is associative reinforcement learning with linear value functions. For this model our technique improves the regret from O(T3/4) to O(T1/2).},

We propose a method of automatic ma- chine translation evaluation that is quick, inexpensive, and language-independent, that correlates highly with human evalu- ation, and that has little marginal cost per run. We present this method as an auto- mated understudy to skilled human judges which substitutes for them when there is need for quick or frequent evaluations.},

  Abstract                 = {Relational reinforcement learning is presented, a
learning technique that combines reinforcement
learning with relational learning or inductive logic
programming. Due to the use of a more expressive
representation language to represent states, actions
and Q-functions, relational reinforcement learning
can be potentially applied to a new range of
learning tasks. One such task that we investigate is
planning in the blocks world, where it is assumed
that the effects of the actions are unknown to the
agent and the agent has to learn a policy. Within
this simple domain we show that relational
reinforcement learning solves some existing problems
with reinforcement learning. In particular,
relational reinforcement learning allows us to
employ structural representations, to abstract from
specific goals pursued and to exploit the results of
previous learning phases when addressing new (more
complex) situations.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses the problem of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) in Markov decision processes, that is, the problem of extracting a reward function given observed, optimal behaviour. IRL may be useful for apprenticeship learning to acquire skilled behaviour, and for ascertaining the reward function being optimized by a natural system. We rst characterize the set of all reward functions for which a given policy is optimal. We then derive three algorithms for IRL. The rst two deal with the case where the entire policy is known; we handle tabulated reward functions on a nite state space and linear functional approximation of the reward function over a potentially in- nite state space. The third algorithm deals with the more realistic case in which the policy is known only through a nite set of observed trajectories. In all cases, a key issue is degeneracythe existence of a large set of reward functions for which the observed policy is optimal. To remove...},

  Abstract                 = {The authors present several versions of a general model, titled the E-7. Reader model, of eye movement control in reading. The major goal of the modeling is to relate cognitive processing (specifically aspects of lexical access) to eye movements in reading. The earliest and simplest versions of the model (E{\~{}}Z Readers 1 and 2) merely attempt to explain the total time spent on a word before moving forward (the gaze duration) and the probability of fixating a word; later versions (E-Z Readers 3-5) also attempt to explain the durations of individual fixations on individual words and the number of fixations on individual words. The final version (E-7. Reader 5) appears to be psychologically plausible and gives a good account of many phenomena in reading. It is also a good tool for analyzing eye movement data in reading. Limitations of the model and directions for future research are also discussed. In his seminal book, The Psychology and Pedagogy of Read-ing, Huey (1908) wrote that to completely analyze what we do when we read would almost be the acme of a psychologist's achievements, for it would be to de-scribe very many of the most intricate workings of the human mind, as well as to unravel the tangled story of the most remarkable specific performance that civilization has learned in all its history,},

  Abstract                 = {Traditionally, semantic information in computational lexicons is limited to notions such as selectional restrictions or domain-specific constraints, encoded in a ''static'' representation. This information is typically used in natural language processing by a simple knowledge manipulation mechanism limited to the ability to match valences of structurally related words. The most advanced device for imposing structure on lexical information is that of inheritance, both at the object (lexical items) and meta (lexical concepts) levels of lexicon. In this paper we argue that this is an impoverished view of a computational lexicon and that, for all its advantages, simple inheritance lacks the descriptive power necessary for characterizing fine-grained distinctions in the lexical semantics of words. We describe a theory of lexical semantics making use of a knowledge representation framework that offers a richer, more expressive vocabulary for lexical information. In particular, by performing specialized inference over the ways in which aspects of knowledge structures of words in context can be composed, mutually compatible and contextually relevant lexical components of words and phrases are highlighted. We discuss the relevance of this view of the lexicon, as an explanatory device accounting for language creativity, as well as a mechanism underlying the implementation of open-ended natural language processing systems. In particular, we demonstrate how lexical ambiguity resolution-now an integral part of the same procedure that creates the semantic interpretation of a sentence itself-becomes a process not of selecting from a pre-determined set of senses, but of highlighting certain lexical properties brought forth by, and relevant to, the current context.},

  Abstract                 = {Supervised Learning in Multi-Layered Neural Networks
(MLNs) has been recently proposed through the
well-known Backpropagation algorithm. This is a
gradient method which can get stuck in local minima,
as simple examples can show. In this paper, some
conditions on the network architecture and the
learning environment are proposed which ensure the
convergence of the Backpropagation algorithm. It is
proven in particular that the convergence holds if
the classes are linearly-separable. In this case,
the experience gained in several experiments shows
that $MLNs$ exceed perceptrons in generalization to
new examples.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a method for calculating lower bounds on the space required and local ambiguities entailed by parsing strategies. A fast, compact natural language parser must implement a strategy with low space requirements and few local ambiguities. It is also widely assumed in the psycholinguistics literature that extremely limited short-term space is available to the human parser, and that sentences containing center-embedded constructions are incomprehensible because processing them requires more space than is available. However, we show that the parsing strategies most psycholinguists assume require less space for processing center-embedded constructions than for processing other perfectly comprehensible constructions. We present alternative strategies for which center-embedded constructions do require more space than other constructions.},
